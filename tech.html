        <p>
            <b>Patience Clarke</b> is my name. I prefer to be called Pat or <i>Pclarke</i>. I'd rather have  the Patience Silent. Learning coding, I  realise I need my name to stay put. Really, one has to patient and put in a lot of <EM>time and effort</EM> to succeed in this path.
        </p>
        <p>I love the fact that I have chosen a career path in high demand. This thought keeps me going. The feeling I get when I see the outcome of the codes I have written is out of this world. </p>
        <P>Although it does not look fantastic yet, I can bodly say I am proud of myself.</P>

            <h4><b>What’s the difference between margin and padding in CSS?</b></h4>
            <p>In CSS, a margin is the space around an element’s border, while padding is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.</p>

           <p>The element above has padding of 10px on the left and right sides, and padding of 15px on the top and bottom sides:</p>
